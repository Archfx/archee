Minimal slide to cover the bare PCB and hold the battery. You can print multiple straps like in the photo by scaling the print, or as one continuous piece. Print standing up and you may want to use a brim support to improve print-plate adhesion.

**Changelog**
* Rev 1 - Initial design

**Parts List**
* Single printed part
* A square of the packing foam from the beepberry box to cushion the battery, about the size of the battery

**Instructions**
* Sandwich the packing foam between the battery and PCB, make sure there are no kinks in the battery wires
* Slide the print from the bottom using the PCB as rails
* That's it!
