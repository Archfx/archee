**Parts List**
* Two printed parts
* Two plastic screws - I used these: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GDYNJNM.  Maybe you can find silber buttonhead that match the m2.5 screws.
* Four M2.5 scriws - I used the screws from this pack: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L06CUJG.
* A square of the packing foam from the beepberry box to cushion the battery, about the size of the battery

**Instructions**
* Print face down/back down. Supports are totally optional on the openings.
* Remove the top two screws from the pi.  Leave the screws holding it to the pogo pins.
* Put the foam between the battery and PCB, orient the battery so it doesn't cross its wire.
* Press the case together.  The foam should compress without much force.  Be careful not to damage the battery.
* Screw together.
* That's it!
